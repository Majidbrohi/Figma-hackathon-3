🔗 **Day 3: API Integration & Data Migration** 🔗 

Today’s challenge was both technical and rewarding as I delved into **API integration** and **data migration** for the website. Using **Sanity**, I explored how to seamlessly connect and manage content while ensuring data flows smoothly between systems. 

Here’s what I focused on: 
🌐 **API Integration**: Connecting external services and ensuring smooth communication between the backend and frontend for a dynamic, data-driven user experience. 
📦 **Data Migration**: Transferring and structuring data efficiently to maintain consistency, accuracy, and scalability across the platform. 
⚙️ **Sanity Integration**: Leveraging Sanity's CMS capabilities to manage content dynamically and future-proof the website. 

It’s amazing to see how technical planning transforms into functional components that power the website. Every line of code takes us one step closer to making this vision a reality! 

Looking forward to tackling the next challenge! 🚀
