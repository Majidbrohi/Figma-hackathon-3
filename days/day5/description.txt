ðŸš€ Day 5: Hackathon Hustle! ðŸ’»
Today, Iâ€™m diving into testing, error handling, and backend refinements for my Next.js e-commerce project as part of our hackathon challenge. ðŸ›’âœ¨
From ensuring smooth functionality to handling edge cases gracefully, it's all about delivering a dynamic, user-friendly platform. The focus is on:
âœ… Error Handling: Making the app robust by catching and fixing potential bugs.
âœ… Backend Refinements: Optimizing APIs and data flow for better performance.
âœ… Website Testing: Ensuring everything works seamlessly, from product pages to checkout flows.
The process has been a rollercoaster of learning and problem-solving, but thatâ€™s what makes it exciting! ðŸ™Œ
Any tips for testing or refining e-commerce projects? Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts! ðŸ‘‡
