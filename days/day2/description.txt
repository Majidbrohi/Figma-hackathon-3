💡 **Day 2: Diving Into Business and Technical Planning** 💡 

As the journey continues, today’s focus was all about **business planning** and outlining the **technical requirements** for the website. Building on yesterday’s foundation, I explored how to bridge the gap between creative ideas and practical implementation. 

Here’s what I worked on today: 
🔍 **Business Strategy**: Refining the revenue model, understanding the target audience, and setting clear goals to ensure the website’s profitability and scalability. 
⚙️ **Technical Blueprint**: Identifying tools, technologies, and frameworks needed to bring the website to life, while ensuring performance, security, and a great user experience. 

This exercise reinforced how important it is to align business objectives with the right tech stack. Every detail counts when you’re building something sustainable and impactful! 

Can’t wait to see how this vision unfolds in the coming days. 🚀
